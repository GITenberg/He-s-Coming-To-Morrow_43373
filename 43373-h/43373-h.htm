</div>

<div class="drop-cap">MY soul vibrated for a
moment like a harp.
Was it true? The
night, the long night
of the world's groping agony
and blind desire? <i>Is</i> it almost
over? <i>Is</i> the day at hand?</div>

<p>Again: "<span class="smcap">They shall see the
Son of man coming in a cloud,
with power and great glory.</span>
<i>And when these things come to pass,
look up and rejoice, for your redemption
is nigh.</i>"</p>

<p>Coming!&mdash;The Son of man
really coming into <i>this</i> world
again with power and great
glory?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Will this really ever happen?
Will this solid, commonplace
earth see it? Will these skies
brighten and flash? and will upturned
faces in this city be watching
to see Him coming?</p>

<p>So our minister preached in a
solemn sermon; and for moments,
at times, I felt a thrill of
reality in hearing. But as the
well-dressed crowd passed down
the aisle, my neighbor, Mr.
Stockton, whispered to me not
to forget the meeting of the bank
directors on Monday evening,
and Mrs. Goldthwaite poured
into my wife's ear a charge not
to forget her party on Thursday;
and my wife, as she came
out, asked me if I had observed
the extravagant toilet of Mrs.
Rennyman.</p>

<p>"<i>So</i> absurd," she said, "when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
her income, I know, cannot be
half what ours is! and I <i>never</i>
think of sending to Paris for my
things; I should look on it as
morally wrong."</p>

<p>I spoke of the sermon. "Yes,"
said my wife, "what a sermon!&mdash;so
solemn. I wonder that all
are not drawn to hear our rector.
What could be more powerful
than such discourses? My dear,
by the by, <i>don't</i> forget to change
Mary's opal ring for a diamond
one. Dear me! the Christmas
presents were all so on my mind
that I was thinking of them every
now and then in church; and
that was <i>so</i> wrong of me!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said I, "sometimes
it seems to me as if all
our life were unreal. We go to
church, and the things that
we hear are either true or false.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
If they are true, what things
they are! For instance, these
Advent sermons. If we are
looking for <i>that</i> coming, we
ought to feel and live differently
from what we do! Do we really
believe what we hear in church?
or is it a dream?"</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> believe," said my wife
earnestly&mdash;she is a good woman,
my wife&mdash;"yes, I <i>do</i> believe, but
it is just as you say. Oh, dear!
I feel as if I am very worldly&mdash;I
have so many things to think
of!" and she sighed.</p>

<p>So do I; for I knew that I, too,
was very worldly. After a pause
I said: "Suppose Christ should
really come this Christmas and
it should be authoritatively announced
that He would be here
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I think," said my wife, "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
would be some embarrassment
on the part of our great men,
legislators, and chief councilors,
in anticipation of a personal interview.
Fancy a meeting of the
city council to arrange a reception
for the Lord Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "He would
refuse all offers of the rich and
great. Perhaps our fashionable
churches would plead for His
presence in vain. He would not
be in palaces."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said my wife earnestly,
"if I thought our money separated
us from Him, I would give
it <i>all</i>&mdash;yes, <i>all</i>&mdash;might I only
see Him."</p>

<p>She spoke from the bottom of
her heart, and for a moment her
face was glorified.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> see Him some day,"
said I, "and the money we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
willing to give up at a word from
Him will not keep Him from us."</p>

<p>That evening the thoughts of
the waking hours mirrored themselves
in a dream.</p>

<p>I seemed to be out walking in
the streets, and to be conscious
of a strange, vague sense of
<i>something</i> just declared, of which
all were speaking with a suppressed
air of mysterious voices.</p>

<p>There was a whispering stillness
around. Groups of men
stood at the corners of the street,
and discussed an impending something
with suppressed voices.</p>

<p>I heard one say to another:
"<i>Really</i> coming! What? to-morrow?"
And the others said:
"Yes, to-morrow; on Christmas
Day He will be here."</p>

<p>It was night. The stars were
glittering with a keen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
frosty light; the shops glistened
in their Christmas array; but
the same sense of hushed expectancy
pervaded every thing.
There seemed to be nothing doing;
and each person looked wistfully
upon his neighbor as if to
say, Have you heard?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I walked, an
angel-form was with me, gliding
softly by my side. The face was
solemn, serene, and calm. Above
the forehead was a pale, tremulous,
phosphorous, radiance of
light, purer than any on earth&mdash;a
light of a quality so different
from that of the street-lamps,
that my celestial attendant
seemed to move in a sphere alone.</p>

<p>Yet, though I felt awe, I felt
a sort of confiding love as I said:
"Tell me, is it really true?
<i>Is</i> Christ coming?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He is</span>," said the angel. "To-morrow
He will be here!"</p>

<p>"What joy!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Is it joy?" said the angel.
"Alas, to many in this city it is
only terror! Come with me."</p>

<p>In a moment I seemed to be
standing with him in a parlor
of one of the chief palaces of the
city. A stout, florid, bald-headed
man was seated at a table covered
with papers, which he was
sorting over with nervous anxiety,
muttering to himself as he
did so. On a sofa lay a sad-looking,
delicate woman, her
emaciated hands clasped over a
little book. The room was, in
all its appointments, a witness
of boundless wealth. Gold and
silver, and gems, and foreign
furniture, and costly pictures,
and articles of <i>virtu</i>&mdash;everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that money could buy&mdash;were
heaped together; and yet the
man himself seemed to me to
have been neither elevated nor
refined by the confluence of all
these treasures. He seemed
nervous and uneasy. He wiped
the sweat from his brow, and
spoke:</p>

<p>"I don't know, wife, how <i>you</i>
feel; but <i>I</i> don't like this news.
I don't understand it. It puts a
stop to everything <i>I</i> know anything
about."</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" said the woman,
turning towards him a face pale
and fervent, and clasping her
hands, "how can you say so?"</p>

<p>And as she spoke, I could see
breaking out above her head a
tremulous light, like that above
the brow of an angel.</p>

<p>"Well, Mary, it's the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I don't care if I say it. I don't
want to meet&mdash;well I wish He
would put it off! What does He
want of me? I'd be willing to
make over&mdash;well, three millions
to found an hospital, if He'd be
satisfied and let me go on. Yes,
I'd give three millions&mdash;to buy
off from to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is He not our best friend?"</p>

<p>"Best friend!" said the man,
with a look half fright, half
anger. "Mary, you don't know
what you are talking about!
You know I always hated those
things. There's no use in it; I
can't see into them. In fact, I
<i>hate</i> them."</p>

<p>She cast on him a look full of
pity. "<i>Cannot</i> I make you see?"
she said.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you can't. Why,
look here," he added, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to the papers. "Here is what
stands for millions! To-night
it's mine; and to-morrow it will
be all so much waste paper; and
then what have I left? Do you
think I can rejoice? I'd give
half; I'd give&mdash;yes, <i>the whole</i>,
not to have Him come these
hundred years." She stretched
out her thin hand towards him;
but he pushed it back.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" said the angel
to me solemnly. "Between him
and her there is a "<span class="small">GREAT GULF</span>
<i>fixed</i>." They have lived in one
house with that gulf between
them for years! She cannot go
to him; he cannot go to her.
To-morrow she will rise to
Christ as a dewdrop to the sun;
and he will call to the mountains
and rocks to fall on him&mdash;not
because Christ hates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>him</i>, but because <i>he</i> hates
Christ."</p>

<p>Again the scene was changed.
We stood together in a little low
attic, lighted by one small lamp&mdash;how
poor it was!&mdash;a broken
chair, a rickety table, a bed in
the corner where the little ones
were cuddling close to one another
for warmth. Poor things!
the air was so frosty that their
breath congealed upon the bedclothes,
as they talked in soft,
baby voices. "When mother
comes, she will bring us some
supper," said they. "But I'm so
cold!" said the little outsider.
"Get in the middle, then," said
the other two, "and we'll warm
you. Mother promised she would
make a fire when she came in,
if that man would pay her."
"What a bad man he is!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the oldest boy; "he never pays
mother if he can help it."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and
a pale, thin woman came in,
laden with packages.</p>

<p>She laid all down, and came
to her children's bed, clasping
her hands in rapture.</p>

<p>"Joy, joy, children! Oh, joy,
joy! Christ is coming! He will
be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>Every little bird in the nest was
up, and the little arms around
the mother's neck; the children
believed at once. They had
heard of the good Jesus. He had
been their mother's only friend
through many a cold and hungry
day, and they doubted not He
was coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! will He take
us? He will, won't He?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my little ones," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
said softly, smiling to herself;
"He shall gather the lambs with
His arms, and carry them in
His bosom."</p>

<p>Suddenly again, as by the
slide of a magic lantern, another
scene was present.</p>

<p>We stood in a lonely room,
where a woman was sitting with
her head bowed forward upon her
hands. Alone, forsaken, slandered,
she was in bitterness of spirit.
Hard, cruel tongues had spoken
her name with vile assertions,
and a thoughtless world had believed.
There had been a babble
of accusations, a crowd to rejoice
in iniquity, and few to pity.
She thought herself alone, and
she spoke: "Judge me, O Lord!
for I have walked in my integrity.
I am as a monster unto many;
but thou art my strong refuge."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment the angel touched
her. "My sister," he said, "be
of good cheer. Christ will be
here <i>to-morrow</i>."</p>

<p>She started up, with her hands
clasped, her eyes bright, her
whole form dilated, as she seemed
to look into the heavens, and
said with rapture:</p>

<p>"Come, Lord, and judge me;
for Thou knowest me altogether.
Come, Son of man; in Thee have
I trusted; let me never be confounded.
Oh, for the judgment-seat
of Christ!"</p>

<p>Again I stood in a brilliant
room, full of luxuries. Three or
four fair women were standing
pensively talking with each other.
Their apartment was bestrewn
with jewelry, laces, silks, velvets,
and every fanciful elegance of
fashion; but they looked troubled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"This seems to me really awful,"
said one, with a suppressed
sigh. "What troubles me is, I
know so little about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said another, "and it
puts a stop to everything! Of what
use will all these be to-morrow?"</p>

<p>There was a poor seamstress
in the corner of the room, who
now spoke. "We shall be ever
with the Lord," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know what
that can mean," said the first
speaker, with a kind of shudder;
"it seems rather fearful."</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, "it
seems so sudden&mdash;when one
never dreamed of any such thing&mdash;to
change all at once from
this to that other life."</p>

<p>"It is enough to <i>be with Him</i>,"
said the poor woman. "Oh, I
have so longed for it!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>The great gulf</i>," again said the
angel.</p>

<p>Then again we stood on the
steps of a church. A band of clergymen
were together. Episcopalian,
Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
Old School and New
School, all stood hand in hand.</p>

<p>"It's no matter now about
these old issues," they said. "<i>He</i>
is coming; He will settle all.
Ordinations and ordinances, sacraments,
creeds, are but the scaffolding
of the edifice. They are
the shadow; the substance is
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>!" And hand in hand
they turned their faces when the
Christmas morning light began
faintly glowing; and I heard them
saying together, with one heart
and voice:</p>

<p>"Come, <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>! come
quickly!"</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
